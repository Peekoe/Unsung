## Unsung

Spring Capstone 2022. My objective for this project is to create a side-scroller RPG within Unity2D to showcase growth in game development, programming/software development, and artistic ability. To keep the scope of this project realistic, I will work on a short first chapter of the game’s story featuring
the chosen ‘hero’ for a playable demo.

Goals for the Semester:

* Unity build (.exe) of the demo
  * title screen
  * simple transitions, cutscenes, sound effects
  * simple animations
  * dialogue boxes for on-screen narrative and conversations
  * item inventory and party member stat screen
  * turn-based battle system and separate health pools for characters & enemies
* GitHub repository with README and access to scripts
* Itch.io page for the demo (free download)
* Visual assets and tilesets for the characters, enemies, items, environments, etc. if custom
  * design process, initial sketches of characters, maps, & worldbuilding
* Music assets/soundtracks if custom
  * mp3/wav format
